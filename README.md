    Spring Boot

        is a spring framework module that offers RapidApplicationDevelopment
        through AutoConfiguaration and through EmbededServewrs, it offers
        server-less applications

        Spring Boot Projects are calle dSpring Starter Projects, and
        Spring Boot offers starter-dependencies for each and every spring module,
        these starter dependencies will contain the respective module along with 
        the minmum config....


        @SpringBootApplication  =   @Configuaration + @ComponentScan + @PropertySource + @AutoConfig

        Spring Boot Runners, are components that offer a run() method to be executed
        once teh spring boot application initiates. We can have any number of runners and the 
        runners are of a wide variety. CommandLineRunner is a common runner used to
        execute anything on a console based interface. Similarly we WebRunners ...etc.,

    Spring Data JPA

        is a spring framework module that offer dynamic implementation to 
        repositories.

        CrudRepository
            | - JpaRepository

        @Entity
        @Table(name=emps)
        class Employee {
            @Id
            @GeenratedValue(strategy=AUTO)
            private Long empId;
            private String empName;
            private String emailId;
            private Double salary;
            private LocalDate joinDate;

            //constructors, getters and setters...
        }

        public interface EmployeeRepo extends JpaRepository<Employee,Long> {
            
            boolean existsByEmailId(String emailId);
            Optional<Employee> findByEmailId(String emailId);
            List<Employee> findAllByEmpName(String empName);

            @Query("SELECT e FROM Employee WHERE e.salary BETWEEN :lb AND :ub")
            List<Employee> getEmployeesEarningInTheRange(Double lb,Double ub);
        }

        EmployeeRepo ::
            Employee save(Employee entity);
            boolean existsById(Long id);
            Optional<Employee> findById(Long id)
            List<Employee> findAll()
            void deleteById(Long id)

    CaseStudy - TaskManager
    --------------------------------------

        is a single user console based application to record and manage the tasks
        to be done by a user:

            A task is a record attibuted by taskId,taskDescription,assignedDate and status (PENDING/DONE)

            Requirement are 
                able to add a task
                retrive all tasks
                retrive all pending tasks
                retrive all completed tasks
                change the status of a task
            
    Spring Web

                                each action is expected to be marked with @RequestMapping or its sub-types
                                each action is expected to return a viewName as a String or an object of ModelAndView class.

Case Study: Inventory Management Portal
-------------------------------------------------------------

    Navigation Bar we will have three links
        Home        for home page (ideally an empty page for landing)
        Items       Display the list of items page with detials (itemCode,itemName,unitOfMeasure,rate,stock)
        New ITem    Displaya form to add a new itme and once the form is submitted 
                    the item has to be added and the 'list of items page' must appear

            on each item row we need a link to edit tiem, delete itme and manage stock

            'manage stock' will take us to stock-page having the below details

                txnId,party name,stock in,stock out

            'mange stock' page we need a form to add a stock transaction.
